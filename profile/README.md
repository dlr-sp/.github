With its mission on software research, development and engineering,
the DLR Institute of Software Methods for Product Virtualization contributes to a comprehensive digitalization
along the lines of the DLR aeronautics vision “virtual product”.

The institute’s research and engineering activities are particularly targeted at
enabling coupled multiphysics analyses and optimizations by means of high-fidelity simulations
leveraging the potential of state-of-the-art high-performance computers.
